# Various Utility Scripts I have made


## cdk - change directory by keyword
A bash script that lets you change the directory via keyword/path pairs in a a file rather than typing out the whole directory.

I made this script because I was tired of typing out long path names just to switch to my school folders

To use this, put the files in the cdk/ folder somewhere, and add a line to your .bashrc that sources the cdk.sh file. Then, change the `keywordFile` variable in `cdk.sh` to match the path to your keyword file. Add your own keywords, and your all set!
