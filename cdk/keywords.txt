# This file defines keyword and path associations for my custom 
# cdk function in my .bashrc
#
# The format for the file is simple. Comments start with '#' on the first line
# All other lines follow the form:
# <keyword> "<path>"
#
# The custom function looks for the line with the given keyword, and then 
# the directory to the string after. The script also prints all non-comment
# and non-whitespace lines for the help screen

# General directories
